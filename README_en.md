## Project Introduction

In this digital age, AI chat experiences have become an integral part of our daily lives. While there are several offline deployable AI chat clients available on the market, the installation and deployment barriers often leave non-technical users feeling overwhelmed. To address this issue, we are excited to introduce **Chat Workstation** ‚Äî a simple yet powerful AI chat client designed to provide a seamless user experience.

**Chat Workstation** is built on Open WebUI, inheriting its outstanding user experience. We have encapsulated it using Electron technology, aiming to provide a native client for Windows, Linux, and Mac platforms. Once installed, you can enjoy a smooth and hassle-free chat experience with a single click.

### Key Features

- **Easily create personal chatbots**: Experience personalized AI chatting.
- **Localized knowledge base**: Meet your individual needs.
- **Support for plugin functions and tool code**: Enhance functionality with powerful extensions.
- **Compatible with multiple backend large models**: Such as locally deployed Ollama, ChatGPT OpenAI API, Microsoft Azure OpenAI API, Alibaba Cloud's large model OpenAI API, and theoretically supports all OpenAI-compatible API services.

### Project Vision

We believe that **Chat Workstation** is not just a simple tool; it empowers users with freedom of choice and reduces dependency on specific service providers. In the future, as the demand for remote large model computing services skyrockets, the standardized API implementation allows you to flexibly choose different services without the need to modify your local bots and knowledge bases.
